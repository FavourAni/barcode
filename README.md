## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    height: 19vw;
}
```



### Continued development

I'd be focusing on using more of CSS flexbox in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/1Rs2ND1ryYc)) - This helped me to understand CSS flexbox and display options. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
